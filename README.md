# Satellite Image Brightness Normalizer 

Project Description This project addresses the problem of inconsistent brightness levels in satellite images. It normalizes the brightness of satellite images to improve clarity and analysis. This solution can be particularly useful in preprocessing satellite imagery for various machine learning or GIS applications.

How to Run the code 1.Ensure Python 3.x is installed. 2.Install required libraries: pip install pillow numpy pandas os zipfile math matplotlib time UnifiedImageError 3.Place the satellite_images.zip file in the working directory. 4.Run the script: 5.python brightness_normalizer.py 6.The normalized images will be saved in the output_images/ directory. Dependencies First, install the required dependencies:

pip install pillow numpy pandas os zipfile math matplotlib time UnifiedImageError Expected input: (satellite_images.zip)

Output: (normalize_image1.png to normalized_image10.png)
